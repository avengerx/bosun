Welcome to Bosun's documentation!
=================================

Bosun is a runtime environment for BESM and associated models. It is used to
document and automate the tasks related to running a climate model (prepare
inputs, compile the code, run the model, archive the results). It is based
on Fabric and can be used as a library or CLI.
