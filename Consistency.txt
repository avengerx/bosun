It is necessary to check the consistency of the run. Probably inside the tasks.py

I'll list here to keep track what is necessary

- NPES

     &ocean_model_nml
      layout = 8,6,  !48npes

     must be consistent with

     mom4p1_coupled_run.csh
     npes          = 48
     aprun -n $npes   $executable > fms.out


- start date

    date at INPUT/coupler.res need to agree with input.nml

      * Luiz: Kind of. If we don't put a current_date at input.nml the model
        uses the date at coupler.res. One check less to make, and we avoid
        duplicated information.

- diag table

    When tot_sum period is not coherent with the restart block period (smaller
    or bigger), how it is generated? Throw a warning?
